# Step Counter

A simple and multiplatform step counter for your smartphone, built with flutter and the package [pedometer](https://pub.dev/packages/pedometer).

### How to run it?
- Make sure you've got flutter sdk configured in your machine.
- Run ``flutter pub get`` to install dependencies
- Run ``flutter run`` to run the project in development mode (I recommend using ``flutter run -v`` so that you can see detailed logs)
